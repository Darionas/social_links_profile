## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- AngularJS

But created with :heart:

### Used techniques

- BEM
- Accessibility

### What I learned

- Angular's default behaviour is to set display:inline for components. This means the component will take as much width as its content. In order to set a width on the component itself, you should define it's display property as display: inline-block or display: block.

### Continued development

- Learning AngularJS

### Useful resources

- [To set element width](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74065064/cannot-set-width-of-component#answer-74065118) It let's define element width.
